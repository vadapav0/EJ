1. JSP (JavaServer Pages):
JSP is a server-side technology used to create dynamic web content. It allows embedding Java code in HTML using special tags. It’s compiled into a servlet and executed on the server, generating HTML for the client.

2. Servlet:
Servlets are Java programs that run on a web server, handling client requests (like HTTP GET and POST). They are used to build dynamic web applications by interacting with databases, processing input, and generating responses.

3. EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans):
EJB is a server-side component architecture for building scalable, transactional, and secure enterprise-level applications. It simplifies the development of large-scale business logic components.

 4. Types in EJB:
Session Beans: Handle business logic (Stateless, Stateful, Singleton).
Entity Beans: Manage persistent data (deprecated in favor of JPA).
Message-Driven Beans (MDB): Handle asynchronous messages from Java Message Service (JMS).
5. Request Dispatcher:
Used to forward a request to another resource (like another servlet or JSP) or to include the content of another resource in the response. This allows for modular web application design.

6. Cookies:
Small pieces of data stored on the client side, sent to the server with each request. Cookies help maintain state, such as user preferences or session information.
[09:13, 9/28/2024] Simonnn: 7. Session:
A mechanism to store user-specific data across multiple requests within a single web interaction. It’s maintained by the server and can store user data like login information.

8. JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library):
A collection of tags used in JSP to simplify common tasks like loops, conditionals, XML processing, and SQL queries. It reduces the need to write Java code directly in JSP.

9. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
An API in Java to interact with relational databases. JDBC allows executing SQL queries and retrieving results from a database, enabling database-driven Java applications.
[09:13, 9/28/2024] Simonnn: 10. JDBC Drivers (4 Types):
Type 1: JDBC-ODBC bridge (deprecated).
Type 2: Native-API driver (partly platform-dependent).
Type 3: Network Protocol driver (middleware-based).
Type 4: Thin driver (pure Java, database-specific).
11. Hibernate:
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework in Java that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables. It reduces the need for explicit SQL queries and handles persistence.

12. Apache Tomcat:
An open-source web server and servlet container for deploying Java Servlets and JSPs. It serves as a lightweight, efficient platform for web application hosting.

13. GlassFish:
An open-source application server that supports the full Java EE platform, including technologies like EJB, JSP, Servlets, and JMS. It’s used for deploying enterprise Java applications.
